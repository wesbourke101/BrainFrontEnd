# 🧠 Digit Span Task

This is a cognitive training web app designed to help users improve **working memory** through a classic **digit span task**. It is clean, accessible, and optimized for measurable mental performance rather than gamification.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Briefly displays a sequence of digits.
- After a short delay, asks the user to recall the digits.
- If the forward recall is correct, it then asks for the reverse order.
- Awards points based on performance:
  - 1 point for correct forward recall.
  - 1 additional point for correct reverse recall.
  - Partial credit for partial correctness.
- Automatically adjusts difficulty by changing digit length based on user performance.
- Provides a round-by-round summary and total score at the end.
